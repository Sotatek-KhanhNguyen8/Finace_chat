Inflation comes in hotter than expected in March,"US consumer prices came in hotter than expected in March, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday morning.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% over the previous month and 3.5% over the prior year in March, an acceleration from February's 3.2% annual gain in prices. The data matched February's month-over-month increase.
Both measures came in ahead of economist forecasts of a 0.3% monthly increase and a 3.4% annual increase, according to data from Bloomberg.
The hot print complicates the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates as the central bank works to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. Fed officials have categorized the path down to 2% as ""bumpy.""
Investors now anticipate two 25 basis point cuts this year, down from the six cuts expected at the start of the year, according to updated Bloomberg data.

On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in March climbed 0.4% over the prior month and 3.8% over last year — matching February's data. Both measures were higher than economist expectations of a 0.3% monthly increase and a 3.7% annual gain.
Markets sank following the data's release, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) jumping more than 14 basis points to touch above 4.5% for the first time in 2024.
""Today’s crucial CPI print has likely sealed the fate for the June FOMC meeting with a cut now very unlikely,"" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in reaction to the print. ""This marks the third consecutive strong reading and means that the stalled disinflationary narrative can no longer be called a blip.""
""In fact, even if inflation were to cool next month to a more comfortable reading, there is likely sufficient caution within the Fed now to mean that a July cut may also be a stretch, by which point the US election will begin to intrude with Fed decision making,"" Shah added.
Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, agreed, adding the hotter data may push more policymakers ""into the two-rate cut camp.""
""The Fed has a bias toward cutting interest rates this year, but the strength of the labor market and recent gains in inflation are giving the central bank the wiggle room to be patient,"" Sweet said. ""If the Fed does not cut interest rates in June, then the window could be closed until September because there is little data released between the June and July meetings that could alter the Fed’s calculus.""

Retail sales topped Wall Street estimates in March,"Retail sales topped Wall Street analysts' expectations in March as consumers continued to spend despite a higher interest rate environment.
Retail sales for the month increased 0.7% from the previous month, according to Census Bureau data. Economists had expected a 0.4% increase in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile retail sales in February were revised up to an increase of 0.9%, from a prior reading of 0.6%.
This is the second consecutive monthly uptick in retail sales, suggesting January's surprise 1.1% decrease was more an aberration than a trend.
March sales, excluding auto and gas, increased by 1%, above consensus estimates for a 0.3% increase.
""The strong rise in retail sales in March and upward revision to February’s data will further support the Fed’s stance that there is no rush to start lowering interest rates,"" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
Nonstore retailers led the gains by category, rising 2.7%. The largest decline came in sporting goods and hobby stores, where sales fell 1.8%.
The update on consumer spending comes as the economy has largely remained on solid footing to start 2024. Consensus projections for economic growth in the first quarter have moved higher while the labor market has continued to add more jobs than previously expected.
This strength in the economy has come as recent inflation prints have shown price increases aren't easing as quickly as initially hoped. The combination of stickier-than-expected inflation with an economy that's still growing has economists believing the Federal Reserve can wait longer to cut interest rates without tipping the economy into recession.
""There are some troubling signs of potential threats to spending power for consumers on the lower-end of the income spectrum, but these threats are not enough to tip the aggregate spending data lower,"" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""Confidence in continued labor market strength alongside strong savings stocks among retirees are going to combine to underpin strong consumer spending for the foreseeable future.""

Consumers are getting frustrated with stalling inflation,"Inflation isn't falling as rapidly as it did last year, and consumers are taking notice.
On Friday, the latest University of Michigan survey showed consumers expect inflation to hit 3.1% in the next year, an increase from expectations of 2.9% seen during March. Expectations for long-run inflation also increased, clocking in at 3%, above the 2.8% reading in the prior month.
The one-year inflation projections are now just above the 2.3% to 3% range seen in 2018 and 2019 before the fallout from the pandemic in 2020 sent inflation to a 40-year high.
""A slight uptick in inflation expectations in April reflects some frustration that the inflation slowdown may have stalled,"" Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu said in a release.
The move higher comes just two weeks after the same University of Michigan survey showed inflation expectations were sitting at their lowest level in about three years, reflecting recent volatility in inflation prints.
A hotter-than-expected consumer prices reading sent markets into a tizzy on Wednesday as investors pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts amid fears inflation's decline may be slowing.
On Thursday, wholesale price increases told a slightly different story. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) showed core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% month over month in March, down from a 0.3% increase in February.
Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance the prevailing takeaway from the two inflation prints is one the Federal Reserve has been talking about a lot recently: ""Volatile inflation is the reality for the next several years,"" Gordon said.
Consumer inflation expectations are frequently mentioned by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
In a speech at Stanford University on April 3, Powell spoke extensively about the importance of the general public's perception of inflation's path forward.
""Having the public expect inflation to return to 2%, despite it moving up, that's a very important factor in bringing inflation back down,"" Powell said. ""If price-setters and wage-setters in the economy believe that inflation will be 2%, then that will actually happen.""
He added: ""It would be a concern if inflation expectations were not to be consistent with the outcome that we seek.""
Economists largely reasoned that Friday's report doesn't push expectations to a level of concern for the Fed yet.
Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown noted that inflation expectations still aren't at a level that should trigger ""serious concern,"" but the fact that they are on the rise again could ""raise some eyebrows.""

"Inflation: Grocery prices reaccelerate, now 25% higher than pre-pandemic","Like the rest of inflation data, grocery prices are coming in hotter after slightly moderating last year.
The cost of groceries remained flat in March and is up 1.2% year over year, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is the first month of year-over-year acceleration in US grocery prices since August 2022, breaking an 18-month streak of deceleration, per a note from JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman.
Since COVID began in March 2020, the cost of food at home has jumped 24.6%.
But the cost of dining out continues to grow at a higher pace due to persistent labor inflation, higher commodities costs, and other reasons. Since COVID, the price of dining out has increased 25.6%.
In March, meals at restaurants and bars cost 4.2% more than a year ago, though it's the smallest 12-month change since June 2021, per BLS economist Steve Reed. Prices are up 0.3% compared to February.
Reed said that restaurant prices have been ""a little bit slower to decelerate, but it has, sort of, finally been decelerating recently.""
Consumers are still paying up, Wells Fargo agricultural economist Michael Swanson told Yahoo Finance.
""As consumers ... we haven't said no, yet. When you go out and look at restaurants, they're still quite full ... so the restaurant industry is saying, 'Okay, if the demand is there, I'm going to price accordingly,'"" Swanson said.
Some grocery items are cheaper compared to the month prior, including cereal and bakery products (down 0.9%), ham (down 2.7%), shelf-stable fish and seafood (down 1.9%), ice cream and related products (down 0.5%), butter (down 5%), and peanut butter (down 2.4%).
Cereal and bakery products saw their largest month-over-month decrease since the BLS first started monitoring the index in 1989, per Reed. Swanson said ""competition has caught up"" for producers within this category, driving down prices.
""They're really [starting] to focus on market share. They're using those promotions, whether it's buy one, get one; coupons; all those traditional ways of trying to get consumers to buy their brand and not somebody else's,"" he said.
Butter saw its biggest month-over-month drop since May 2002, while sugar and sweets had their largest decline since July 2020. The category has been under pressure as cocoa prices surpassed $10,000 per metric ton for the first time last month.
Compared to a year ago, though, sweets are up 4.3%, as producers face higher costs when it comes to ingredients, packing, labor, and transportation.

Housing inflation still sticky in March: 'Little progress over the past nine months',"Housing costs remained elevated in March, raising concerns over when a recent easing of apartment rents will show up in the US government's inflation data — and if the softening will hold.
The shelter component of the Consumer Price Index, which is mostly made up of rent and homeowners' equivalent rent (OER), rose 0.4% over the previous month, matching February’s month-over-month gain, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Wednesday. Shelter costs rose 5.7% year over year, also flat from the previous month's annual increase.
“The monthly pace of shelter inflation has remained stubbornly elevated around 0.45% since last June despite market-based measures of rent growth cooling much more significantly over the past year,” Parker Ross, global chief economist at Arch Capital Group, told Yahoo Finance.
Ross said he expects “the BLS measure of rent inflation to cool and reflect some of the observed softness in rents, but we now have less conviction after little progress over the past nine months.”
Apartment rents softened last year by some metrics, and economists are expecting the trend to eventually show up in CPI data, which has a lag.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a March press conference that housing inflation would start to trend lower, but there was some “uncertainty” on when that would happen.
“There's real confidence that they [lower housing costs] will show up eventually over time, but again, [there is] uncertainty about the exact timing,” Powell said.
Shelter costs accounted for 60% of March’s overall monthly gain in core CPI, which doesn't include food and energy, according to BLS.
Some Wall Street economists expect the shelter component of CPI to bottom out by spring or summer of next year based on how sticky the number has remained.
But there's concern that there are signs that the growth in rents is ticking back up this year.
“Given the shift in preference to the single-family rental market, we could see persistently elevated rent growth on the single-family side, which would put upside pressure over the medium term,” Ross said.

Don Rissmiller at Strategas Research Partners said rising immigration may push up rents as well.
“The labor supply boost from recent immigration has been welcome. But the flip side of that is there will be additional demand as well — and the question is whether we will have the housing over the next several years that the additional individuals will require,” Rissmiller told Yahoo Finance.

Another hot inflation reading fans fears Fed will push back rate cuts,"Another hotter-than-expected inflation reading is fueling investor fears that the Federal Reserve will have to push back the number and timing of interest rate cuts this year.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% over the prior year in March, an acceleration from February's 3.2% annual gain in prices and more than economists expected.
The year-over-year change in the so-called ""core"" CPI — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — was 3.8%, which was the same level as February but a tenth of a percent higher than expected.
""There is no doubt this is somewhat disappointing,"" Greg Daco, EY chief economist, told Yahoo Finance, adding that ""there is no denying that this firmer inflation print does put more pressure on policymakers to sustain likely a higher-for-longer monetary policy stance.""
Investors agree. The stock market fell following the CPI release, and the odds in favor of a June rate cut from the Fed evaporated, stomping out what had been a commonly held belief on Wall Street.
Traders who had been betting on a June cut now see a roughly 85% chance the Fed does nothing in June and a roughly 41% chance of a cut in July.
They also scaled back the number of rate cuts they see this year to two, less than the median of three penciled in by Fed officials at their last policy meeting in March.
The minutes of that meeting released Wednesday showed that ""almost all"" participants agreed there would be rate cuts at some point this year even as some noted that hotter inflation readings at the start of the year shouldn’t be discounted as ""statistical aberrations.""
""Participants generally noted their uncertainty about the persistence of high inflation and expressed the view that recent data had not increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2%,"" according to the minutes.
Fed officials agreed, however, that they had reached the peak on the current rate-tightening cycle and that monetary policy was well positioned to respond to the economic outlook, including the possibility of keeping rates higher for longer if inflation drops more slowly.
They expect there to be bumpy, uneven monthly inflation readings on the path to their 2% inflation target

Since that March meeting some Fed officials have offered new warnings that the number of cuts they expect in 2024 could be reduced if inflation continues its hot streak and the economy keeps accelerating.

Why auto insurance costs are rising at the fastest rate in 47 years,"As car prices moderate from a pandemic-era surge, insurance has pushed the cost of car ownership to the brink for many Americans.
New data out on Wednesday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed auto insurance costs last month were 22.2% higher than they were a year ago and increased from February's 20.6% year-over-year gain. March's rise in insurance costs is the largest gain since December 1976, when prices rose 22.4% over the prior year.
The sticker shock hitting many American drivers is being driven by a rise in accidents, the severity of accidents, and geographical factors combining to create a perfect storm and push costs higher.
'Severity' and bodily injury claims on the rise
The most alarming factor driving insurance costs higher is more severe claims.
""In general, the numbers of crashes, injuries, and fatalities are up, and inflation has made the cost of repairs more expensive,"" AAA spokesperson Robert Sinclair told Yahoo Finance.
Sinclair said motorists developed ""bad habits"" on the road during pandemic lockdowns, contributing to current behavior. For example, as the New York Times reported earlier this year, researchers in Nevada discovered that during the pandemic, motorists were speeding more (and driving through intersections), seat belt use was down, and intoxicated driving arrests were up to near-historic highs.

Sinclair also pointed to NHTSA data, which found that in 2021, at the height of the pandemic, road fatalities increased by 10.5% to their highest level since 2005, even while most Americans stayed at home. The NHTSA said it was the highest percentage increase it had ever seen. The agency found that fatalities in 2022 only decreased by 0.3% as compared to 2021.
Insurance tech firm Insurify found that auto insurance premium hikes were ""largely due to the skyrocketing price of auto parts and the increasing number and severity of claims."" And while increases may moderate, analysts still believe further premium hikes are on the horizon.
""While the magnitude of rate increases is likely to ease somewhat, after several years of double-digit increases, some lingering claim cost inflation and adverse claim severity and frequency will likely lead to a 'higher for longer' auto rate environment,” CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert told Yahoo Finance.
Not surprisingly, severe accidents leave insurance companies with rising loss ratios, or a share of premiums collected that insurers paid out in claims.
""Broadly speaking, severity in [the] auto [business] is running mid- to high-single digits — think closer to mid in the vehicle severity, think closer to high in bodily injury — and so that's sort of where trends are running today,"" Travelers (TRV) personal insurance president Michael Klein said during the insurance giant's latest earnings call in January.

US economy has Wall Street 'borderline speechless' after blowout March jobs report,"The prevailing story of a strong US economy hasn't changed much in the past year as economic data has persistently topped Wall Street's expectations.
Friday's March jobs report was more of the same.
The economy added 303,000 jobs during the month, nearly 100,000 more than consensus expectations. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, hovering near a historically low level, while the percentage of Americans participating in the workforce increased.
""The data leaves us borderline speechless,"" Jefferies US economist Tom Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""We were optimistic about the payroll numbers coming into today based on recent trends in jobless claims and momentum from prior months, but we did not expect to see such strong data around the periphery and within the details.""
It's the latest in a recent string of positive economic news. Earlier this week, data showed the manufacturing sector has entered expansion territory. Meanwhile, the hiring rate is at a steady pace seen prior to the pandemic and layoffs have held in a low range, signaling no sign of a slowdown in labor market activity. This comes as labor productivity is picking up for the first time in 15 years.
All of these incremental pieces have forecasters boosting their outlook for US economic growth for 2024. Consensus now sees quarter-over-quarter real economic growth coming in at 2% for the first three months of the year, up from the 1.8% projection seen in March.
Supply and demand
A key factor in the robust economy has been a rise in the US population and, subsequently, an increase in available workers. According to the data released Friday, March labor force participation picked up to 62.7% from 62.5% in February. That rate stands just below the 62.8% reading seen just before the pandemic. This came as wage growth, a potential indicator of future inflationary pressures, decreased to 4.1%, its lowest level since June 2021.
This exemplifies an ideal scenario for the labor market, where job growth continues but not at the cost of higher inflation.
BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder reasoned the ""positive"" supply shock from increased immigration is helping create the current ""pro-growth"" yet disinflationary labor market dynamics.
The economics team at Goldman Sachs also recently referenced increased immigration when boosting their GDP forecast this year. On Friday, the team's chief US economist David Mericle wrote that this likely won't come at the cost of higher inflation.
